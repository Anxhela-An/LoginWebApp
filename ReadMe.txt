This is a simple web application that I have developed for learning purposes.

The objectives were:
1. Practicing the knowledge about Java EE components (JSP, Servlets, web servers, html scripts)
2. Learning how to use Tomcat for hosting Java web applications
3. Establishing the database connectivity using JDBC.

The users enter into the application and they can login for exploring a random list of videos. The credentials are verified by the database (e.g. username: anxhela, password: anxhela) and if the data entered isn't correct, the users wil be prompted again into the login page. This can also happen after the logout option.
